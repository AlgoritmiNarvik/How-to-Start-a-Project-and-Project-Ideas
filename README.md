# How to Start a Project and Project Ideas

Welcome to the Algoritmi Club's guide to starting a project and exploring new ideas! This repository serves as a resource for members of the Algoritmi Club at UiT, Narvik, who are interested in launching or joining a project. Here, you'll find guidelines on how to get started, a collection of current and future project ideas, and links to our ongoing projects.

## About Algoritmi Club

Algoritmi is a student-driven club at UiT Narvik, focused on programming, AI, and technology innovation. We meet every Thursday at 5 PM in room E1600. Our goal is to create a collaborative environment where students can develop their skills, work on real-world projects, and build a strong professional network.

## How to Start a Project

Starting a project at Algoritmi is simple and straightforward. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Find a Team or Start One:**
   - **Join a Team:** If you have a specific interest, connect with others who share it during our Thursday meetings.
   - **Start Your Own:** Don’t see a project that excites you? Propose a new one and gather a team.

2. **Choose a Project and Propose:**
   - **Browse Ideas:** Check our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/AlgoritmiNarvik) for ongoing projects and ideas.
   - **Propose a New Idea:** Whether it’s AI, software development, or something else, your ideas are welcome. Submit your proposal to [algoritmi@samfunnet.no](mailto:algoritmi@samfunnet.no).

3. **Plan and Budget:**
   - Outline what you want to achieve.
   - Estimate the resources you’ll need—time, software, hardware, etc.
   - If necessary, apply for small grants or sponsorships through the club.

4. **Weekly Meetings:**
   - Join us every Thursday at 17:00. Use our weekly meetings to discuss progress, share challenges, and get feedback.

5. **Documentation and Sharing:**
